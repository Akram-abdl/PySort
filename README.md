## Introduction

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer allows you to visualize the process of sorting an array using different sorting algorithms. This project uses Matplotlib to create dynamic bar charts that represent the elements being sorted.

## Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are currently supported:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Installation

To use Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, you'll need Python 3.6 or higher and Matplotlib. You can install Matplotlib using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

If you haven't already, clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git```
```cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer```

## Usage

To run Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, execute the ```main.py``` file:

```python main.py```

You'll be prompted to choose a sorting algorithm from the list. Enter the number corresponding to the desired algorithm, and the visualizer will display the sorting process in real-time.
